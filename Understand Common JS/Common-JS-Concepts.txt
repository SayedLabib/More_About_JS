* types of variable - primitive type and non-primitive type
* Undefined 8 different ways of getting undefined
* truthy and falsely values in JS
* difference between (==) and (===) is - 
    
     double equal only checks if the values are same
     where triple equal not only checks the value rather
     it checks the value and the type of the value.
     Also, equal comparison doesn't work for the non-primitive
     type value

* Block Scope, Global Scope, hoisting
* closures in Js : A closure is basically a function can get access to the
                   outer scope function

* CallBack Function
* Arguments and passby reference - 1. primitive types are pass by value
                                   2. Non-primitive types are pass by reference
