1. javascript is a JIT compiled. multi-pardigm, prototype based 
and Dynamically typed language.(which cllects the garbage file)

2. JS can be worked as Procedural, as OOP as well as functional based
Programming

3. JS code is executed by V8 Engine it is written with C++ which
is a googles Open source Engine and Every browser like edge
and Chrome use it to execute JS code.

4. Java Script is by nature is single threaded
   Now, there is two things in that (asynchronous and Synchronous)

5. Async works on promise. It will show the promised data after a
   short period of time(time should be declared) or, IT will execute
   The operation after all the operation is executed.

6. The setInterval() and setTimeout() functions. Do, near similar
kind of things. I can declare a two parameters into these functions

  the difference is -  execution in the setTimeout will be stooped
  after the decalared time.

  But, the execution in the setTimeInterval() won't be stooped
  it will running just like a clock. But, we can stop it using
  some conditions and then call clearInterval() function
